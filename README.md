# Hospital-database-management-system
### Description
This repository is a Hospital database management system developed using the SQL server.It is designed to handle operations such as managing patients, monitoring their appointment schedules as well as the doctors and medications assigned to them. It also provides room for their reviews/feedbacks.

The database was fuly normalized to #### Third Normal form(3NF)  to ensure data intergrity, avoid redundancy and support scalability.
### Objectives
The goal of this project was to design and implement a relational database to support the core operations of a hospital. It also includes:

- Design a hospital relational database in SQL Server.
- Normalize the schema into 3NF.
- Implement relationships with primary and foreign keys.
- Populate the database with sample data for testing.
- Demonstrate key queries and operations.
  
### Database Schema

#### Main Tables:

1. Patients – stores patient details and login credentials.
2. Doctors – stores doctor information linked to departments.
3. Departments – stores hospital department information.
4. Appointments – tracks patient-doctor appointments.
6. MedicalRecords – stores diagnoses, medicines, and allergies.
7. Reviews – stores patient feedback and ratings for doctors.

      ### Implementation Steps

- Designed and normalized the database schema into 3NF.
-  Created tables in SQL Server with appropriate constraints.
-  Inserted sample data (20–30 rows per table) for testing.
-  Wrote queries to validate relationships and perform operations.
